* Lesson 6: Huffman Coding
1) What is Huffman coding?
2) Explain Huffman coding algorithm?
3) Why do we use Huffman tree?
4) Assume that we have 6 symbols, draw Huffman tree and find codeword of each symbol? You can choose your own values.
5) Find entropy and average codeword length from the word "lessonseemscool"?
